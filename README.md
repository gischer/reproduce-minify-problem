# Meteor Minify Failure

To reproduce the failure, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure meteor is installed (I have verified on Meteor 2.5)
3. Navigate to the top-level directory of the repository
4. Type `meteor build ../output`

This project does not run.  Typing `meteor run` (or just `meteor`) will result
in errors.  If running it is necessary, let me know.
