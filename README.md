# Meteor Minify Failure

To reproduce the failure, perform the following steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure meteor is installed (I have verified on Meteor 2.5)
3. Navigate to the top-level directory of the repository
4. Type `meteor build ../output`

This project will run now if you type `meteor`.  However, it does nothing
of much value beyond reproducing the build error above.
